## Weather as a function of latitude-- an analysis deployed to github pages

### Project Summary
The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset of over 500 random cities around the globe.

After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather with respect to the cityâ€™s latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any apparent trends or correlations.
